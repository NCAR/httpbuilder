HTTPBuilder = Easy HTTP client for Groovy.

Versions:

The original project was abandoned after release 0.7.2
(and that version has come and gone from the public repositories).
Fork based on 0.7.3-SNAPSHOT (same code as release 0.7.2).
This clone uses version numbers like "0.99.x-SNAPSHOT".

0.99.1
- merge original PRs #85 #78 #88 #32 #64
- fix tests (ignore broken websites)

TODO:
- better tests, using a locally running test http(s) server
- fix javadoc comments so the build completes

Local repo deployment:

An easy way to deploy to your local Maven remote repository is:

    mvn -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests \
    -DaltDeploymentRepository=internalMaven::default::file:///PATH/TO/MY/LOCAL/maven2 \
    deploy

You can also deploy the built JAR directly.
Be sure to update the url, file, and version settings as appropriate.

    mvn deploy:deploy-file -Dpackaging=jar \
    -DgroupId=org.codehaus.groovy.modules.http-builder -DartifactId=http-builder \
    -Durl=file:///PATH/TO/MY/LOCAL/maven2 \
    -Dfile=target/http-builder-0.99.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    -Dversion=0.99.1-SNAPSHOT
